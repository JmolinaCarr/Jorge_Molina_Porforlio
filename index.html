			<h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I currently live in the Richmond area, I've lived in Texas for about 9 yrs now. I am originally from Los Angeles, California. I moved to Missouri when i as 14 yrs old to get away from the big city. I lived in a town of about 1,000 people and graduated High School in 2000. I attended college and met my wife, which we have been married for 13 yrs.
                I have 2 kids, Mason 7yrs old (soon to be 8 on Dec. 6) a daughter Skyelynn she is 12 yrs old.

                I have a degree in networking. I am a big fan of working with hardware. I have a server rack full of cisco switches and routes. I enjoy hands on projects and anything that has to do with computers. On my spare time i enjoy fishing and golfing. Recently I have been doing more fishing specially because my daughter has become a huge fan.
                Soon i will purchase a boat so that me and my daughter can do more fishing and create long lasting memories.
